1. Get the application name by running these commands:
  export KPM_POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "oai-xapp-rc-moni.name" . }},app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }}" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
2. To check if the deployment is successfull:
  kubectl logs $KPM_POD_NAME
3. Note: if you can get logs similar to:
"      1 RC Indication Message received:
Unknown RIC indication message received.

      2 RC Indication Message received:
Unknown RIC indication message received.

      3 RC Indication Message received:
Unknown RIC indication message received.

      4 RC Indication Message received:
Unknown RIC indication message received."

then your deployment is working well.
4. The xApp RC only works when UE is successfullly registered to a PDU session.
